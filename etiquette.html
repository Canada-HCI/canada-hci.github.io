            <h1>Etiquette</h1>
            <p>While using the Canada HCI Slack workspace, we would appreciate everyone follow these guidelines to help foster a welcoming and inclusive community.</p>
            
            <h2>Creating your Profile</h2>
            <p>When creating your new profile, tell us a little bit about yourself and your research interests. Be sure to include the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full name (required) and photo (preferred)</li>
                <li>Preferred pronouns (preferred) in the profile description</li>
                <li>Include university or industry affiliation / contact info</li>
                <li>Include a brief summary of research interests or keywords (1-2 sentences)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
            <p>In general, our goal is to create a <sb>positive, polite, and friendly environment</sb>, and <sb>support open discussions in a safe and inclusive setting</sb>. Therefore, any content that is discriminatory, disrespectful, or otherwise unproductive towards these goals will not be tolerated. By adhering to the following simple guidelines, you are doing your part to support a positive environment for all members of the space:</p>
            
            <h5>Be friendly and welcoming</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>This site includes members at all stages of their research careers.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h5>Be patient</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h5>Be thoughtful</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.</li>
                <li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h5>Be respectful</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h5>Be charitable</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.</li>
                <li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Avoid destructive behavior</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid derailing and stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.</li>
                <li>Avoid unconstructive criticism: don’t merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
                <li>Avoid snarky, unproductive, sniping comments.</li>
                <li>Avoid discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.</li>
                <li>Avoid microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h2>Channel Guidelines</h2>
            <p>The Canada HCI Slack workspace has many channels to support targeted announcements and focused discussion, as well as more general forms of discussion. Each channel includes a short overview that outlines its purpose - before posting to a new or unfamiliar channel for the first time, take a moment to read the channel’s overview to ensure you’re reaching your intended audience. Please feel free to create your own channels and keeping them public open so that everyone can participate in discussions.</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy and Non-Disclosure Agreements</h2>
            <p>The Canada HCI Slack channel is an open workspace that welcomes academic and industrial researchers. Due to the open nature of the space, <sb>we cannot guarantee the privacy of novel research ideas nor enforce adherence to non-disclosure agreements</sb> for any materials posted on the space.</p>
            
            <h2>Flagging Inappropriate Content</h2>
            <p>We anticipate that the vast majority of activity and content will fall within the site guidelines and promote friendly, safe, and constructive discussions around HCI research. However, the moderating team reserves the right to remove content that does not align with these goals and take punitive action towards members who violate the guidelines if necessary.</p>
            
            <p>Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The moderating team reserves the right to remove posts and users from the workspace.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To flag content that does not adhere to the guidelines or is otherwise inappropriate, you can privately message any member of the admin / moderating team (visible under “About this Workspace”), or send an email to canadahcidotca [at] gmail.com</p>
