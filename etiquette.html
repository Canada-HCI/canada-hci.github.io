                <h1>Etiquette</h1>
                <p>While using the Canada HCI Slack server, we would appreciate everyone follow these guidelines to help foster a welcoming an inclusive community.</p>
                
                <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
                    <li>Be patient: Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)</li>
                    <li>Be thoughtful: Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted. Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Slack Profile Guidelines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full name and photo preferred (include instructions on how to upload)</li>
                    <li>Preferred pronouns in the profile description</li>
                    <li>Include university or industry affiliation / contact info</li>
                    <li>Include a brief summary of research interests or keywords (1-2 sentences)?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Posting Guidelines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>When posting to a channel, take a moment to read the channel overview and think about whether your message is relevant to all members of the channel - if not, there may be a more appropriate channel</li>
                    <li>When responding to a post, take a moment to think about whether all members of the channel will be interested in your discussion, or if your response would be better suited as a DM to the original poster</li>
                </ul>
